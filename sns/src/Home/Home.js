        <h3>The Story</h3>
    <p className="us">There are many beautiful things in this world,
    separated best friends not being one of them.
    In the fateful Summer of 2017, he who we know
    as The Snob moved away in order to pursue a career
    in film thus abandoning the one true love he may ever
    know, The Slob. After months of bickering, bantering,
    and fairy tale flirting over texts and messages, itâ€™s
    time to bring the incoherent arguments front and center.
    Each week, we plan on discussing what it is that we believe
    needs to be said about film at that given time with an
    emphasis on new releases. The hope is that you walk away
    not only learning something new about movies each week, but
    also learning a little something about yourself along the
    way. We hope you join us for what is sure to be an hour and
    a half worth of groans and ughs upon hearing our diagnosis
    on the relevant topics each given week.</p>
